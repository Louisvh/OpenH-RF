"""Refresh the cached scan of the dataset.

Re-lists ``nvidia/OpenH-RF``, records the revision it listed, and streams the
HDF5 metadata for every file that needs it. ``site/update.py`` runs it.

The tip of the repo is checked first, and a repo that has not moved ends the
refresh in a second. A new revision rarely rewrites the whole dataset, so the
HDF5 objects at the old and new revisions are compared by their LFS sha256 and
only the files whose content changed are scanned again (a full rescan takes
about 80 minutes).
