"""Stream HDF5 metadata for every file in the dataset.

Opens each ``.hdf5`` over HTTP range requests and records its structure without
downloading the channel data (a few hundred kB of header and small scan arrays
per file, against payloads that run to tens of GB).

Uses a process pool: h5py serialises HDF5 calls behind one global lock, so
threads blocking on network reads inside it would not overlap.

Resumable: paths already in ``data/files/`` are skipped, so an interrupted run
can be relaunched. Only a bounded window of calls is queued, an interrupt drops
that queue, and the workers die with this process (see ``_die_with_parent``).

Stored per dataset: ``data/files/<dataset>.jsonl`` has a line per HDF5 file with
only what that file does not share with the rest of its folder, under a line with
what they share (see ``save``). Files side by side hold nearly the same, so this
is a tenth of the size of a whole record per line, and far from GitHub's 100 MB
limit for a file.

The scan streams from the revision ``fetch_tree.py`` recorded, so a push to the
Hub during an 80-minute scan cannot leave the output straddling two releases.

A step of ``refresh_data.py``.
