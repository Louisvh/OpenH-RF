# Rotational 3D Ultrasound Raw Channel Data for Elevational SAF

*Top view down the rotation axis of a point target at 20 mm depth, 6 mm off-axis, [`data/tall_elev_H12__point_z020_r6.hdf5`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/blob/main/wpi/data/tall_elev_H12__point_z020_r6.hdf5). Magenta is the naive per-angle reconstruction, filling in as the array (white line) sweeps 180° about the rotation axis (small circle); cyan is the paired eSAF label shipped in the file; white is where both agree. eSAF collapses the rotational smear arc back onto the target (arc-FWHM 1.26 → 0.39 mm).*

## Dataset Description

Rotational 3D ultrasound acquisitions of point, pair and off-axis targets, captured with an **elevation-focused 1D linear array rotated 180° about its axial axis** (1° steps). Each acquisition stores the **raw per-element channel RF** of a single normal plane-wave transmit at every rotation angle, i.e. the data before in-plane beamforming, which enables flexible offline beamforming and **elevational Synthetic Aperture Focusing (eSAF)**. Every file also carries the eSAF-reconstructed 3D volume as a paired label.

The release is mostly **simulated (Field II)**: a grid of 10 probe types × 19 targets spanning depths where the elevational beam thickness (the artifact eSAF corrects) varies. It is complemented by 5 **measured phantom** rotational scans with the physical Japan Probe 68-element array (same geometry as the simulation) at 10–45 mm depth. No human or animal subjects.

## Intended Usage

Advanced beamforming and **elevational resolution recovery** for rotational 3D US (eSAF), elevation-PSF / aperture-growth studies, and a reproducible raw-channel-data benchmark for rotational synthetic-aperture reconstruction.

## Dataset Characterization

- **Data Collection Method:** synthetic and phantom.
  - *Simulated (190):* Field II (MATLAB, `xdc_focused_array` + `calc_scat_multi`), scatterers rotated about the axial axis with the transducer fixed. **10 probe types** vary lateral aperture (`n_el` 32/68/128, pitch 0.1/0.2/0.3 mm), elevation height `H` (4/8/12 mm) and elevation focus `R` (25/45/90 mm or unfocused), encoded in the probe name (`tall_elev_H12` = `H` 12 mm; `baseline_R45_H8` = `R` 45 mm, `H` 8 mm) and in `probe/*`.
  - *Measured (5):* rotational scans of the Japan Probe 68-element array on a wire/point phantom with a Galil-controlled 180° rotation, acquired as 7-angle CPWC, time-tag-synced to the motor angles and reduced to the centre (0°) plane wave per angle to match the simulation schema.
- **Labeling Method:** synthetic ground truth. Target positions are exact, and each file's `description` attribute records probe and target, e.g. `probe=tall_elev_H12 target=point_z020_r6 r0=6.0mm z=20.0mm`. The paired eSAF volume (`custom/saf_bmode`) is the label.
- **Acquisition system:** Japan Probe JP_Linear_68 (baseline): 68 elements, pitch 0.2 mm, element width 0.15 mm, element height 8 mm, elevational lens focus 45 mm; center frequency 10 MHz; sampling 40 MHz; sound speed 1490 m/s; one normal plane-wave transmit per rotation angle; 180° rotation in 1° steps. Parameters match the paper simulation.

## Processing the Dataset

The acquisitions can be processed with the `reconstruct.py` [script](https://github.com/open-h/OpenH-RF/blob/main/datasets/wpi/reconstruct.py) as provided in the [OpenH-RF GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-h/OpenH-RF), together with the `pipeline.yaml` definition in this folder and the [zea library](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea). The script streams the data from the Hugging Face Hub, beamforms the rotation frame closest to ±90° (where an off-axis target lies in-plane) and plots it beside the per-frame rotation angle from `metadata/probe_pose`. Set `ZEA_FILE` and `FRAME` at the top of the script to pick another acquisition or frame. The default, frame 90 (~−90°) of [`data/experiment__acq_exp_30mm.hdf5`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/blob/main/wpi/data/experiment__acq_exp_30mm.hdf5), gives:

<p align="center"><img src="assets/bmode.png" width="70%" alt="B-mode frame of the measured phantom at -90 deg probe rotation, with the per-frame rotation-angle trajectory alongside it"></p>

The rotational eSAF itself (in-plane DAS → `recon_3d` → `safrot_backproj`) is the published MATLAB implementation; its output is shipped in every file as `custom/saf_bmode`:

```python
with zea.File("data/baseline_R45_H8__point_z080_r4.hdf5") as f:
    saf = {e.name: e for e in f.custom}  # custom/saf_bmode elements
    volume_db = saf["values"].data  # (1, z, x, y) float32 dB
    coordinates = saf["coordinates"].data  # (z, x, y, 3) float32 m
    print(saf["values"].description)  # axes + eSAF parameters + arc-FWHM
```

## Dataset Format

[zea v0.1.6](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea)

One zea HDF5 file per acquisition, single track. The raw channel RF and scan parameters are in the standard data/scan groups (`tracks/track_0`); the probe rotation per frame is the **`metadata/probe_pose`** trajectory (`euler_xyz`, radians, rotation in the z component, zero translation; `sampling_frequency = 1.0 Hz` is nominal, one pose per frame).

The paired eSAF label is the zea custom field **`custom/saf_bmode`**: `values` is `(1, z, x, y)` float32 in dB (0 dB = volume max, empty pixels −inf) over a ±2 mm depth window about the target, and `coordinates` holds the per-pixel `[x, y, z]` in metres. It lives in `custom` rather than the data group because it is a single frame, while `raw_data` has ~180. The per-case arc-FWHM before/after is in the `description` of `custom/saf_bmode/values`.

Pre-processing: none for the simulations beyond the forward model; for the measured scans, frame-to-angle synchronisation, per-angle dwell averaging and centre-plane-wave selection. Both remain raw per-element RF (not demodulated or decimated).

## Dataset Quantification

**Current OpenH-RF release:** 195 HDF5 files; 1.87 GB (1,870,462,976 bytes) stored; root `zea_version` **0.1.6**. Sizes include all HDF5 contents and use decimal units (MB = 10^6 bytes, GB = 10^9 bytes, TB = 10^12 bytes), not decoded-array memory or original-source download sizes.

- **Acquisitions:** **195** = **190 simulated** + **5 measured phantom**.
  - *Simulated (190):* **10 probe types × 19 targets** (16 single points over depth {20,45,80,130} mm × radial offset from the rotation centre {0,2,4,6} mm, plus 3 pair/oblique cases). The probe axis is listed above under Data Collection Method; each file's own `description` attribute gives its exact probe/target/r0/depth. (The earlier compatible set has 18 acquisitions.)
  - *Measured (5):* real rotational phantom scans at nominal depths {10,20,30,40,45} mm (`experiment__acq_exp_*.hdf5`), centre plane wave, ~182 measured rotation angles over ~180°.
- **Frames per acquisition:** simulated 180 (one per 1° step); measured ~182 (the actual encoder angles are stored in `metadata/probe_pose` — z Euler component, radians — not necessarily uniform).
- **Stored HDF5 size:** 1.87 GB (1,870,462,976 bytes), including the paired `saf_bmode` label volumes.
- **Train/val/test split:** N/A (benchmark / characterization set; the probe × depth × radius axes are the intended study dimensions).

### Per-sample feature table
Shapes use placeholders because dimensions vary across the probe grid and between simulated and measured scans: **`n_frames`** = 180 (simulated, one per 1° step) or ~182 (measured encoder angles); **`n_el`** ∈ {32, 68, 128} (probe grid; 68 for the baseline and all measured scans); **`n_ax`** = axial sample count (per case); **`n_z`** = depth samples of the label volume (target ± ~2 mm window).

Paths below are inside each `.hdf5`; with `zea.File` use `f.data` / `f.scan` / `f.metadata.probe_pose`, and `f.custom` for the SAF label volume.

## Subject Metadata

No human or animal subjects / no PHI. Each file stores `metadata/subject/type`: `simulated phantom` for the Field II simulations, `phantom` for the measured `experiment__*` scans. Creator attribution is stored per file in `metadata/credit`.

## Data Validation

`reconstruct.py` beamforms a single rotation frame with the `pipeline.yaml` chain (Cast → Demodulate → Beamform(delay_and_sum) → EnvelopeDetect → Normalize → LogCompress) and plots the stored rotation trajectory beside it, as a check on the acquisition parameters and the frame-to-angle mapping.

The eSAF labels were checked per case with the arc-FWHM of the rotational smear before and after eSAF, shown here annotated for the case in the hero image:

## Known Issues

- **Paired SAF label — on-axis targets (r0 = 0) do not narrow, by design.** eSAF refocuses the *rotational elevation smear*; a target sitting on the rotation axis has essentially no smear, so its `saf_bmode` label volume is not sharper than the input (arc-FWHM gain ≈ 1). This is expected physics, not a defect — the 40 on-axis cases (median gain 1.00×) are included so the pair covers the degenerate no-smear case. Off-axis targets (n=120, median gain 1.75×, up to ~12×) and paired/oblique targets (n=30, median 3.71×) improve clearly; targets at the focal depth (~45 mm) and weak-elevation-focus probes (`efocus_deep_90`, `elev_unfocused`) have less smear to recover. Across all 195 cases, median arc-FWHM gain is 1.36× (42 cases < 1×, mostly the on-axis/near-focus group above). Arc-FWHM is measured on a **centred** reconstruction: the smear circle passes through both the rotation axis and the target (not a circle centred on the rotation axis). The eSAF back-projection uses a fixed elevational focus of 45 mm; per-depth focus tuning (see `docs/eSAF_focus_depth_study_JP.md`, source) can further sharpen deep off-axis cases but was not applied here (single as-designed focus).
- **Measured phantom depth window.** The real reflector bead sits **~4 mm off the rotation axis** (not on-axis) and, for each scan, slightly deeper than the folder's nominal depth label; labels are reconstructed over the interactively-identified reflector depth window (not a naive nominal-depth ± 2 mm window), which matters because a mis-centred window can pick up near-axis clutter instead of the actual bead.
- **Simulated** data (Field II spatial-impulse-response model): realistic transducer field, but no tissue attenuation, aberration, multiple scattering, or electronic noise. Not a substitute for measured data.
- Speed of sound is 1490 m/s, matching the paper Table 1 and the experiment.
- A single normal plane-wave transmit per rotation angle is simulated (the dataset stores n_tx = 1); multi-angle compounding is left to downstream users.
- **Measured scans:** acquired as 7-angle CPWC; only the **centre (0°) plane wave** is kept here to match the n_tx = 1 schema. The dwell frames per angle are averaged before storage (noise reduction). Real reflectors are not ideal point scatterers — expect reverberation/clutter near the surface and specular layering; rotation angles are the measured encoder values (slightly non-uniform, full span ≈ 180°, sign per encoder direction). The elevational lens focus is the nominal 45 mm, but the effective back-projection focus for eSAF is depth-dependent on real data (see `docs/eSAF_focus_depth_study_JP.md`, source).

## Ethical Considerations

None. The data is either fully synthetic (Field II) or measured on an inanimate phantom: no human or animal subjects, no PHI, no consent or IRB constraints.
