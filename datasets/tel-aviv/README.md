# Ilovitsh Lab Mice Tumors & Water-Bead Phantoms

![Reconstructed cineloop from 01-scan-3.hdf5](assets/01-scan-3.gif)

*Cine loop of the rotational sweep through a mouse tumor, [`mouse_tumor/seg/01-scan-3.hdf5`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/blob/main/tel-aviv/mouse_tumor/seg/01-scan-3.hdf5), reconstructed from the raw channel data with `mouse_tumor/pipeline.yaml`.*

## Dataset Description

This dataset provides ultrasound data captured via a motorized 1D transducer array. It captures both in-vivo tumors in mice and in-silico water-bead phantoms, and was originally acquired as part of our work on implicit neural representations (INR) [1]. The primary task for this released dataset is the segmentation of tumors (in mice) and water beads (in phantoms) from multi-angle ultrasound acquisitions.

Data was acquired using a motorized 1D array transducer with 128 elements (IP104, Sonic Concepts) operated by a Vantage 256 system (Verasonics Inc.). For the in-vivo data, 5 breast cancer tumor-bearing mice were scanned under anesthesia. Each volume was sampled across a 180° rotation at 1.25° intervals, yielding 144 angular frames per acquisition. At each angle, five plane waves were steered linearly between -5° and 5°.

Each beamformed B-mode image was semi-manually annotated by a non-professional using MedSAM [2]. Volumetric comparison of these segmentation masks against manual measurements produced a mean volumetric error of 6.8% ± 1.5%.

## Intended Usage

Segmentation of tumors in mice and water-bead phantoms.

## Dataset Characterization

- **Data collection method:** Phantom (agarose with water beads) and Animal (in-vivo mice).
- **Labeling method:** Semi-automatic, labelled with MedSAM [2].
- **Acquisition system:** 128-element phased array (IP104, Sonic Concepts) with a 0.22 mm pitch, 13.5 mm elevation aperture, and center frequency of 3.5 MHz. Controlled by Vantage 256 (Verasonics Inc.) and a motorized rotary (RTY-IP100). Sampling rate 14 MHz.

## Processing the Dataset

The acquisitions can be processed with the `reconstruct.py` [script](https://github.com/open-h/OpenH-RF/blob/main/datasets/tel-aviv/reconstruct.py) as provided in the [OpenH-RF GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-h/OpenH-RF), together with the `pipeline.yaml` definitions in `mouse_tumor/` and `phantom/` and the [zea library](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea). The script streams the data from the Hugging Face Hub and overlays the stored segmentation on the reconstructed B-mode.

## Dataset Format

[zea v0.1.6](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea)

## Dataset Quantification

**Current OpenH-RF release:** 22 HDF5 files; 4.36 GB (4,357,947,392 bytes) stored; root `zea_version` **0.1.6**. Sizes include all HDF5 contents and use decimal units (MB = 10^6 bytes, GB = 10^9 bytes, TB = 10^12 bytes), not decoded-array memory or original-source download sizes.

- **Samples / frames:** 22 total `.hdf5` acquisitions. Each acquisition contains 144 angular frames covering a 180° rotation (1.25° increments) of 5 plane waves.
- **Train / val / test split:** N/A
- **Stored HDF5 size:** 4.36 GB (4,357,947,392 bytes).
