# TU/e Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Curved-Array Channel Data

![Reconstructed cineloop from AAA_subject11.hdf5](assets/AAA_subject11.gif)

*Cine loop of [`data/AAA_subject11.hdf5`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/blob/main/tue-aaa/data/AAA_subject11.hdf5), reconstructed from the raw channel data.*

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains ultrasound channel data acquired in vivo from patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The dataset consists of ultrafast acquisitions obtained using a curved array ultrasound transducer operating in diverging wave transmission mode with a Verasonics system. The data capture raw radio frequency (RF) channel signals at high frame rates, enabling access to the full spatiotemporal information.

## License / Terms of Use

[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.en). Retain attribution and identify modifications when reusing the data.

## Intended Usage

- Advanced beamforming
- Motion estimation

## Dataset Characterization

- **Data collection method:** clinical
- **Acquisition system:** Verasonics Vantage, C5-2v curved array, 128 elements, center frequency 3.6 MHz
- **Transmit sequence:** 15 steered diverging waves (polar angles −12° … +12°)

## Processing the Dataset

The acquisitions can be processed with the `pipeline.yaml` definition in this folder and the [zea library](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea).

`zea` streams the data from the Hugging Face Hub and processes it according to the pipeline. You can try it out with the following command:

```bash
zea process \
  --dataset hf://nvidia/OpenH-RF/tue-aaa/data/AAA_subject11.hdf5 \
  --config hf://nvidia/OpenH-RF/tue-aaa/pipeline.yaml
```

Alternatively, you can use the `reconstruct.py` [script](https://github.com/open-h/OpenH-RF/blob/main/datasets/tue-aaa/reconstruct.py) as provided in the [OpenH-RF GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-h/OpenH-RF).

## Dataset Format

[zea v0.1.4](https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea)

zea file format. Subject metadata is stored under `metadata/subject` (`age`, `sex`, `bmi`); attribution under `metadata/credit`.

## Dataset Quantification

**Current OpenH-RF release:** 15 HDF5 files; 53.08 GB (53,077,606,400 bytes) stored; root `zea_version` **0.1.4**. Sizes include all HDF5 contents and use decimal units (MB = 10^6 bytes, GB = 10^9 bytes, TB = 10^12 bytes), not decoded-array memory or original-source download sizes.

- **Samples / frames:** 15 acquisitions (one HDF5 file each), 500 frames per acquisition — 7,500 frames total
- **Stored HDF5 size:** 53.08 GB (53,077,606,400 bytes).

| Field | Shape | dtype | Units | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `raw_data` | `(N_frames, N_tx, N_ax, N_el, 1)` | int16 | — | Raw RF channel data |

## Subject Metadata

Patients are dominantly male (13 M / 2 F), aged 66–87, and scanned in the Netherlands.

## Data Validation

A `zea.Pipeline` (cast → axial window → demodulate → DAS beamforming → envelope detection → normalization → log compression) is defined in `pipeline.yaml`. Run `reconstruct.py` to reproduce the reference B-mode image (`AAApatient01_bmode.png`).

## Known Issues

N/A

## Ethical Considerations

The experiment protocol was approved by the local ethics review board of the Catharina Hospital Eindhoven on 22 December 2023 (ID-number: nWMO-2023.115) and written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to scanning.
