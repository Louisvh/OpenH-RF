"""Example reconstruction script for the dartmouth-uct dataset of OpenH-RF.

Dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/tree/main/dartmouth-uct

Delay-and-sum reflectivity reconstruction of ring-array USCT channel data.

The transmits are individual point sources firing in turn rather than a
wavefront steered from the receive aperture, so the standard
``zea.ops.Beamform`` delay model does not apply; ``zea.ops.USCTReflectivityDAS``
is the dedicated operation for this geometry.

Both sub-datasets reconstruct with the same pipeline -- the 2D full-ring (256
transmits) and the 3D ring (64 transmits) -- and only the compounding differs
(see COMPOUNDING). The imaging grid defaults to the footprint and resolution of
the ground-truth sound-speed map stored in the file, so the reconstruction is
directly comparable with the ground truth pixel for pixel. Set SOS_MAP to feed
that map to the same operation, replacing the constant-c delays with a
straight-ray integral of the local slowness.

Requires zea>=0.1.6 (https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea), the library that does the
ultrasound processing here, together with one of its Keras backends (JAX,
PyTorch or TensorFlow). Installation instructions are at
https://zea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html.
