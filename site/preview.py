"""Show open pull requests of the Hub repo on the site before they are merged.

``update.py --pr N`` runs this once the clone is at the Hub's main and the scan is up
to date with it. It merges the pull requests into main locally, ``cards.py`` reads the data
cards as they will be once merged, and the clone goes back on main afterwards.

The merge exists only here, so nothing may depend on its commit: the scan in ``stats/data``,
the revision it records and the explorer's download script all stay at main, which has the
same HDF5 files because a pull request that changes one is refused. Each figure a pull
request adds or changes is downloaded from that pull request's commit, which is on the Hub.
